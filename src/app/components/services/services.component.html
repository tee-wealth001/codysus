                            known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical

                        <p>Tesla started working in the telephony and electrical fields before emigrating to the United
                            States
                            in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers,
                            setting up
                            laboratories/companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction
                            motor and
                            transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla as a consultant to
                            help
                            develop an alternating current system. Tesla is also known for his high-voltage,
                            high-frequency
                            power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs which included patented devices and

                            work used in the invention of radio communication, for his X-ray experiments, and for his
                            ill-fated
                            attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower

                        <h1>What we offer</h1>
                        <p>Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician,
                            engineer,
                            inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more
                            than
                            that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been
                            described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and
                            "feverishly
                            inventive imagination". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all
                            time and
                            perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian
                            Helen
                            Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind and
                            personality
                            seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci states that while
                            there
                            is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather
                            than
                            mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.</p>
